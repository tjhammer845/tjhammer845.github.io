                            I am a front-end engineer and digital creator focused on clean and modern designs, user-friendly experiences, and writing maintainable and readable code. With a background in web design, I understand the entire process of creating quality websites and content from conception to completion. In the past, Iâ€™ve worked on a wide variety of web projects and gained invaluable experience as both a developer and designer. Since the beginning of the Covid pandemic, I have spent my time building and improving my digital startup, acquiring clients, and managing/working on the projects for them.

                        <p>Outside of the workplace, I tend to be the fun-loving adventurous type, always seeking new sites and taking on new types of challenges. I like to spend my time cooking, gardening, drawing, weightlifting, running, and mountain biking. I love to stay busy and on the move, both in and out of the workplace.</p>
